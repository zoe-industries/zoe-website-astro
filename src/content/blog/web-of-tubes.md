This is an old Project of mine.

I made this in 2014, while writing it up in 2024 most of the Inspiration resources on the Web are gone.

So i will try to write up what i remember and what i can find in my old notes.

And capture the state of the resources with archive.org as they are right now.

# Inspiration


My first point of contact with knitted clear PVC tubing was via these two Articles from Becky Stern.

# Installation

The instalation was made out of clear PVC tubing. A oversized curcular loom was used to knit a loose meta tube.  
The tube was then filled with green water and air and water was pumped in circulation through it.  
A pump was used to pump the water into the tube. Air was then injected with an air electric air pump through a needle inserted into the hose.  
The return of the hose was connected to an open resovoir letting the air escape and the water flow back into the pump.  
The water and air mixture, when pumped, created a wave like motion in the tube.  
Energy was slowly built ub in the tube, resulting in a slow bubble flow through the tube.  
When built up enough, the tension was regualarly released in a fast wave like bubble motion throug the tube.  

# Pictures

I only have this one Picture of the Installation.  
Since it is now destroyed and i can also take no new pictures.
