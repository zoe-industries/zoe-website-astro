This is an old Project of mine.
The idea was to make a dimable light without any dimming electronics.
So i came up with the idea of a cylinder shaped lamp, where the amount of light coming out of the lamp
is regulated by varying the amount of opaque tube that is exposed.

Since this is an old Project, this is the only photo i have.
I will try to find more and add them here later.
