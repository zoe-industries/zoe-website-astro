# Seidenstrasse


Seidenstrasse is an ad hoc pneumatic tube system, built at Chaos events.

You can find more information about the Seidenstrasse Project here: [Seidenstrasse](/blog/seidenstrasse.html)

# FOMP


FOMP is an OpenSource pneumatic tube system forked from Seidenstrasse

The goal is to develop an OpenSource pneumatic tube system that can be build by anyone.

It is supposed to be a low cost, easy to extend and quick to setup system.

### Goals

*   Low cost
*   Easy to extend
*   Quick to setup
*   Easy to build
*   Able to be stored in a basement and transported by car(gobike)

### What you need

You will need a few things to build your own FOMP system. The most important part is the tubes, vacuum cleaners and some Plumbing parts.  
The Pipe is a DN100 Drainage pipe. It needs to be the variant without perforation!  
When ordering the Tube, make sure that it comes with conectors to connect the tubes to each other.  
Examples:

We had great success with K√§rcher Vacuum cleaners. They dont only have suction but also blow air.  
This enables to operate in a push and pull configuration.  
  
For connecting the Vaccuum cleaners to the pipe you will need a few plumbing parts.  
This is a list of parts that you will need to connect the tubes to the vacuum cleaners when building a decentralised system:

*   1x DN100 to KG100 Adapter
*   1x KG100 Y piece with KG50 and KG100 (straight through) connections
*   1x KG50 to your Vacuum cleaners hose end diameter adapter
*   1x KG100 end cap

There are many diferent Capsule designs. I have listed a couple of them here:

*   [Capsule for Seidenstrasse @ 30C3 by Obelix](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:214574)
*   [MailTubeCapsuleShell by protofALk (this is a quite heavy capsule, might not work in every system)](https://www.youmagine.com/designs/mailtubecapsuleshell)
*   [FMP Capsule by LongHairedHacker](https://github.com/LongHairedHacker/fmp-capsule)
*   [Wide Mouth Nalgene Bottles make for great capsules](https://nalgene.com/product/16oz-wide-mouth-bottle/?attribute_pa_color=blue)
*   DN75 - connection tubes with endcaps do work, too. But are not ideal since they are quite small and can get stuck in the system due to sharp edges on the endcaps

### Building the System

The FOMP system is quite easy to build. You will need to connect the tubes to each other and to the vacuum cleaners.  
The most important part is to make sure that all conections are made fairly airtight.  
Wide PVC electrical tape works great for this.  
  

#### Station Interface

The Station Interface is the part of the system that connects the tubes to the vacuum cleaners.  
While letting the Operator or User insert and recive capsules.  
If a centralised system is used, the Station Interface looks like in this picture

If a decentralised system is used, the Station Interface looks like in this picture
